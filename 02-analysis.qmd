## Goals 

The goal of this analysis is to find for data outliers, interesting localized pieces of data or anything that jumps out as interesting. Specifically, since I'm focusing on water boil notices, I want to identify anything that can lead to a potential story. 

Questions for analysis: 

- What counties and/or regions have the most amount of water boil notices? 
- What counties and/or regions have the longest lasting water boil notices?
- What do ongoing water boil notices look like? 
- What are the most common reasons for water boil notices? Are these statewide or localized problems? 
- How many people in Texas are affected by water boil notices each year?

## What counties and/or regions have the most amount of water boil notices?

Counties: 
```{r}
water_boil_county <- water_boil |>
  group_by(county) |>
  summarize(appearances = n()) |> 
  #arrange(desc(appearances)) |> 
  mutate( state = "TEXAS") 


water_boil_county
```

Download into CSV file: 

```{r}
write_csv(water_boil_county, "/Users/MariaProbert/rwd/water_boil_county.csv")
```


Regions: 
```{r}
water_boil |>
  group_by(region) |>
  summarize(appearances = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(appearances))
```

Based on quick Google searches, the county with the most amount of water boil notices is Harris county (Houston area), Montgomery (area above Houston), Bell (which makes up Temple, Killeen, et.), and in fourth place is Brazoria county (South of Houston). This leads me to think that region 12 according to TCEQ probably encapsulates East Texas. 

Data Takeaways: East Texas or the area near Houston is the area in Texas with the most amount of water boil notices. According to Texas Tribune, could be due to aging infrastructure (humidity?), flood issues and/or a large population.

## What counties and/or regions have the longest lasting water boil notices? 

I want to look at the counties with the longest lasting notice lengths, so let's look at the average to determine the county with the longest lasting notices. Then, I also want to record the minimum and maximum amount of days that water boil notices last in each county. 

Counties (last 2 *** ERROS?!): 
```{r}
water_length <- water_boil |>
  group_by(county) |>
  summarize(
    average_notice_length = mean(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_notice_length = min(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE), 
    max_notice_length = max(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) |>
  arrange(desc(average_notice_length)) |>
  mutate( state = "TEXAS") 


water_length
```

Download into CSV file: 

```{r}
write_csv(water_length, "/Users/MariaProbert/rwd/water_length.csv")
```




None of the top three counties with longest lasting water boil notices show up in the top of the list of most water boil notices. But this makes sense. East Austin has a higher population, therefore a higher demand for water and therefore a higher demand for water boil notices to get resolved. 

Let's look at Live Oak more closely: 


```{r}
water_boil |>
filter(
  county == "LIVE OAK"
) |>
  select(county, population, issued, rescinded, notice_length, reason_activity, reason, affected_area_activity, affected_area, pws_name)

```

Live Oak county is located South of San Antonio and has a very small population, but the water boil notices affect all residents in the area where the public water system is located. Most recent one happened in June and lasted almost a year. 

Now, I want to look at the top three counties with the most water boil notices and check how long their water boil notices last. 

Let's look at Harris as an example: 

```{r}
water_boil |>
  group_by(county) |>
  summarize(
    average_notice_length = mean(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_notice_length = min(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE), 
    max_notice_length = max(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) |>
  arrange(desc(average_notice_length)) |>
  filter(
    county == "HARRIS"
  )
```

When I check for Harris we get NA, which could just mean that there are still pending water boil notices so the data can't calculate the average, minimum and maximum length of water boil notices in the area.

To check the length of the water boil notices that have been rescinded, I added "na.rm = TRUE." 

Data Takeaways: 

- Counties with the longest lasting water boil notices tend to have smaller populations. The top two counties with the longest lasting notices are located South of San Antonio.
- Harris county has at least one pending water boil notice at the time this data was collected. 


Regions: 

Now let's check regions with the longest lasting water boil notices: 

```{r}
water_boil |>
  group_by(region) |>
  summarize(
    average_notice_length = mean(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_notice_length = min(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE), 
    max_notice_length = max(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) |>
  arrange(desc(average_notice_length)) 
```
If I don't remove the NA examples, 12 out of the 16 regions designated by TCEQ in Texas have at least one ongoing water boil notice at the time this data was collected.

Data Takeaways: 

- Region 16 could be the area around Live Oak and Duval counties. The highest average of water boil notice length is 29 days. 
- 12 out of the 16 regions designated by TCEQ in Texas have at least one ongoing water boil notice at the time this data was collected. 

TCEQ hasn't answered my question about what the regions are yet...

## What do ongoing water boil notices look like? 

The original results for the duration of the water boil notices gave us a lot of NA results, which point to water boil notices that are ongoing at the time the data was collected.  

Let's look at the amount of ongoing water boil notices in each county in the time span of Jan. 2022 to the start of 2024. 
```{r}
water_boil |>
  filter(if_any(c(rescinded, notice_length), is.na)) |> 
  group_by(county) |>
 summarize(appearances = n()) |> 
 arrange(desc(appearances))
```

Let's look at the water boil notices in Harris: 

```{r}
water_boil |>
  filter(if_any(c(rescinded, notice_length), is.na)) |> 
  group_by(county) |>
  filter(county == "HARRIS")
```

Let's add up the population affected by ongoing water notices in Harris county: 

```{r}
water_boil |>
  filter(if_any(c(rescinded, notice_length), is.na)) |> 
  group_by(county) |>
  filter(county == "HARRIS") |>
  summarise(harris_population_notice = sum(population))
```

Data Takeaways: In Harris county at the time that this data was collected at least 13,594 people were affected by water boil notices. 

Let's look at the total population affected by water boil notices in each county: 

```{r}
population_ongoing_notice <- water_boil |>
  filter(if_any(c(rescinded, notice_length), is.na)) |> 
  group_by(county) |>
  summarise(county_population_notice = sum(population)) |>
  arrange(desc(county_population_notice))

population_ongoing_notice
```




Let's try this by region and look at populations under water boil notices by region: 

```{r}
water_boil |>
  filter(if_any(c(rescinded, notice_length), is.na)) |> 
  group_by(region) |>
 summarize(appearances = n()) |> 
 arrange(desc(appearances))
```

Data Takeaways: (Once I know what regions this is...) Harris should be 12. 

Now let's look at the total ongoing water boil notices in Texas at the time this data was collected. 

```{r}
water_boil |>
  filter(if_any(c(rescinded, notice_length), is.na)) |> 
  summarize(appearances = n()) 
```

Data Takeaways: In the state of Texas, there were at least 69 total ongoing water boil notices (in all counties and regions) at the time that this data was collected. 

Now let's look at the total population in Texas under ongoing water boil notices: 

```{r}
water_boil |>
  filter(if_any(c(rescinded, notice_length), is.na)) |> 
  summarise(texas_population_notice = sum(population)) 
```

## What are the most common reasons for water boil notices? Are these statewide or localized problems? 

Let's look at the main reasons why water notices happen in the state of Texas. 

```{r}
water_boil |>
  group_by(reason_activity) |>
  summarize(appearances = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(appearances))
```

Now let's check to see if more of these issues are systemwide or more localized problems. 

```{r}
water_boil |>
  group_by(affected_area_activity) |>
  summarize(appearances = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(appearances))
```

BWN stands for boil water notice. 

Data Takeaways: Water boil notices are more related to systemwide issues, rather than localized. But, not by that much of a difference.  

** need TCEQ response to contextualize more of this info*** 

## How many people in Texas are affected by water boil notices each year? 

Without including the ongoing water boil notices that we already looked at, lets look at the total population under  and separating by year. 


```{r}
water_boil |>
  summarize(population_notice = sum(population))
```

## Adding Texas 

```{r}
water_boil |> 
  mutate( state = "TEXAS") 
  
```
