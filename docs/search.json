    "text": "Maria Probert is a UT Austin Journalism and Economics major. She is currently a Data Fellow at UT’s Journalism Media Innovation Group. This group is a part of the Dallas Morning News Innovation Endowment. Maria has done work for UT’s student media like the Daily Texan and has previously interned at the Texas Tribune and Texas Monthly.\nThis project aims to look at what water boil notices look like in Texas. What counties or cities are affected? Why were the water boil notices issues? What caused these water boil notices?\nThe angle of this project focuses more on the local level, in an attempt to highlight communities impacted by water boil notices. The data I used for this project is from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality or TCEQ, and I obtained it from a public records request. Keaton Peters helped guide me when looking at this data.\n###Main Takeaways:\nMap of water boil notices: Link to a headline on index Map Here",

Harris county is one of the most populous counties in Texas.\n\nTCEQ also has water boil notice data based on regions. These regions are specific to TCEQ and can be seen “here”.\nHere I broke down the data by region.\nRegions:\n\nwater_boil |&gt;\n  group_by(region) |&gt;\n  summarize(appearances = n()) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(appearances))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nData Takeaway:\n\nRegion 12 has the most amount of water boil notices at 1,716.

    "text": "What counties and/or regions have the longest lasting water boil notices?\nI want to look at the counties with the longest lasting notice lengths, so let’s look at the average length to determine the county with the longest lasting notices.

I used the same format as above and made sure to include the data and join it to the shapefile. I chose a different color scheme to differentiate the data.\n\nmapview(water_length_shape, zcol= \"average_days\", col.regions= c(\"blue\",\"#5a9ef5\", \"#83cbf6\", \"#5ae2f5\")) \n\nWarning: Found less unique colors (4) than unique zcol values (171)! \nInterpolating color vector to match number of zcol values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Average Water Boil Notice Lenght\n\nData Takeaways:\n\nNone of the top three counties with the longest average amount of days per water boil notice show up in the top of the list of most water boil notices. But this makes sense. For example, places like East Austin have a higher population, therefore a higher demand for water and a higher demand for water boil notices to get resolved.\n\nLet’s look at Live Oak (the county with the longest average water boil notices) more closely:\n\nwater_boil |&gt;\nfilter(\n  county == \"LIVE OAK\"\n) |&gt;\n  select(county, population, issued, rescinded, notice_length, reason_activity, reason, affected_area_activity, affected_area, pws_name)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nLive Oak county is located South of San Antonio and has a very small population. The water boil notices affect all residents in the public water system. The most recent water boil notice happened in June and lasted almost a year.\nNow, I want to look at the top counties with the most water boil notices and check how long their water boil notices last.\nLet’s look at Harris as an example:\n\nwater_boil |&gt;\n  group_by(county) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    average_notice_length = mean(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE),\n    min_notice_length = min(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE), \n    max_notice_length = max(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE)\n    ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(average_notice_length)) |&gt;\n  filter(\n    county == \"HARRIS\"\n  )\n\nWarning: There were 4 warnings in `summarize()`.\nThe first warning was:\nℹ In argument: `min_notice_length = min(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE)`.\nℹ In group 194: `county = \"TERRY\"`.\nCaused by warning in `min()`:\n! no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf\nℹ Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 3 remaining warnings.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWhen I check for Harris we get NA, which means that there is still at least one pending water boil notice at the time that this data was collected. So the data can’t calculate the average, minimum and maximum length of water boil notices in the area.\nTo check the length of the water boil notices that have been rescinded, I added “na.rm = TRUE.” This removes all ongoing water boil notices and gives us a comparable average.\nData Takeaways:\n\nCounties with the longest lasting water boil notices tend to have smaller populations. The top two counties with the longest lasting notices are located South of San Antonio.\nHarris county has at least one pending water boil notice at the time this data was collected.\n\nRegions:\nNow let’s check regions with the longest lasting water boil notices:\n\nwater_length_region &lt;- water_boil |&gt;\n  group_by(region) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    average_notice_length = mean(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE),\n    min_notice_length = min(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE), \n    max_notice_length = max(notice_length, na.rm = TRUE)\n    ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(average_notice_length)) \n\nwater_length_region\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIf I don’t remove the NA examples, 12 out of the 16 regions designated by TCEQ in Texas have at least one ongoing water boil notice at the time this data was collected.\nData Takeaways:\n\nRegion 16 covers Laredo. The highest average water boil notice length is 29 days.\n12 out of the 16 regions designated by TCEQ in Texas have at least one ongoing water boil notice at the time this data was collected.",
