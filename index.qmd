title: "Water Boil Notices in Texas- Maria Probert"
---

Maria Probert is a UT Austin Journalism and Economics major. She is currently a Data Fellow at UT's Journalism Media Innovation Group. This group is a part of the Dallas Morning News Innovation Endowment. Maria has done work for UT's student media like the Daily Texan and has previously interned at the Texas Tribune and Texas Monthly. 

This project aims to look at what water boil notices look like in Texas. What counties or cities are affected? Why were the water boil notices issues? What caused these water boil notices? 

The angle of this project focuses more on the local level, in an attempt to highlight communities impacted by water boil notices. The data I used for this project is from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality or TCEQ, and I obtained it from a public records request. Keaton Peters helped guide me when looking at this data.
